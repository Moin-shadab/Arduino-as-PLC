how to choose its circular size iron core then wire and gauge and turns 
Designing a toroidal coil (or any inductor) requires several steps to determine the key components: the core size, the wire thickness, the number of turns, and the material properties. You're correct that, inside a toroidal coil, there is typically an iron core (or another magnetic material like ferrite or powdered iron) around which the wire is wound. Here's how we can systematically approach the design process:
Key Parameters for Designing a Toroidal Coil

    Core Material: The choice of core material determines the magnetic properties and the size of the core. For industrial power applications, you might use iron powder (for higher current handling) or ferrite (for high-frequency applications).

    Core Dimensions: The core size depends on the power handling capability, inductance, and current requirements.

    Wire Gauge: The wire thickness depends on the amount of current the coil must handle without excessive heating.

    Turns of Wire: The number of turns in the coil determines the inductance and the resistance to the current flow. More turns generally lead to higher inductance, which can filter voltage or limit current.

Step-by-Step Process for Designing a Toroidal Coil
1. Determine Power and Current Requirements
For example, let’s assume you need a 5A or 10A current rating at 230V RMS for your application. The power requirement can be calculated as:

    For 5A at 230V:
    P=V×I=230 V×5 A=1150W
    P=V×I=230V×5A=1150W
  
    So, the coil needs to handle 1150W of power.

    For 10A at 230V:
    P=V×I=230 V×10 A=2300 W
    P=V×I=230V×10A=2300W

    So, the coil needs to handle 2300W of power.

2. Decide on the Core Material

The choice of core material affects the core's magnetic properties and determines how much current it can handle without saturating.

    Ferrite cores are used for high-frequency applications.
    Powdered iron cores are typically used for low-frequency and high-power applications (like for current filtering and voltage regulation).

3. Core Size Calculation

The size of the core is critical because it determines how much magnetic flux the core can support before saturation.

The core size depends on:

    The inductance required.
    The flux density (B_max) of the core material.
    The current rating.

The required core cross-sectional area is determined by the equation:
Acore=Vrms×Irms4.44×f×Bmax×L
Acore​=4.44×f×Bmax​×LVrms​×Irms​​

Where:

    AcoreAcore​ is the core area in square meters (m²).
    VrmsVrms​ is the RMS voltage (230V).
    IrmsIrms​ is the RMS current (5A or 10A).
    ff is the frequency (50Hz for India).
    BmaxBmax​ is the maximum flux density (measured in tesla, T) of the core material. Ferrite cores usually have a B_max of around 0.3 T. Powdered iron can handle slightly higher B_max values, up to 0.5 T.
    LL is the inductance required (which depends on the desired filtering or current-limiting effect).

Example:

If you're designing for a 5A coil with a required inductance of 15.9 mH, the core area calculation would be:
Acore=230 V×5 A4.44×50×0.3×0.0159
Acore​=4.44×50×0.3×0.0159230V×5A​

This will give you a rough estimate of the core area you need. For 10A, the required core area will be about double the size, as larger currents require larger cores.
4. Choose the Core Shape and Dimensions

A toroidal core has the shape of a doughnut, so you'll also need to determine the core's inner diameter (ID) and outer diameter (OD). The thickness of the core (denoted as the radius difference between ID and OD) is typically chosen based on the amount of power the coil will handle.

For example:

    If the core has an ID of 40 mm and an OD of 100 mm, the thickness of the core will be 30 mm.

You can now calculate the circumference of the core at the mean diameter:
Circumference=π×Dmean
Circumference=π×Dmean​

Where:
Dmean=ID+OD2
Dmean​=2ID+OD​

For an ID of 40 mm and OD of 100 mm:
Dmean=40+1002=70 mm
Dmean​=240+100​=70mm
Circumference=π×70≈220 mm
Circumference=π×70≈220mm

Now, you can use this circumference to estimate how many turns of wire can fit on the core.
5. Calculating Number of Turns

The number of turns NN in a coil depends on the desired inductance LL and the core's physical properties. The number of turns is given by the equation:
N=Vrms4.44×f×Bmax×Acore
N=4.44×f×Bmax​×Acore​Vrms​​

From our previous example for 5A and 15.9 mH inductance:
N=2304.44×50×0.3×9.69 cm2≈53 turns
N=4.44×50×0.3×9.69cm2230​≈53turns

For 10A and a larger inductance (say 31.8 mH):
N=2304.44×50×0.3×19.38 cm2≈27 turns
N=4.44×50×0.3×19.38cm2230​≈27turns
6. Determining the Wire Gauge (Thickness)

The wire size is critical for ensuring that the coil can handle the current without excessive heating. The wire thickness should be chosen based on the current carrying capacity of the wire.

For 5A:

    A typical 18 AWG wire can handle up to 10A, so it's safe for 5A.

For 10A:

    A typical 14 AWG wire can handle up to 15A, making it suitable for 10A applications.

7. Winding the Coil

    The number of turns you've calculated will now determine how many layers of wire you'll need to wind around the core. If the core is large, you may need multiple layers of wire.
    Each turn should be wound tight to prevent loose coils and ensure proper inductance.
    Insulation between layers is necessary to prevent short circuits between turns.

Example: Design for 5A Coil

For a 5A coil with the following parameters:

    Voltage: 230V RMS
    Power: 1150W
    Core material: Powdered iron or ferrite
    Frequency: 50Hz
    Inductance: 15.9 mH
    Number of turns: 53 turns (from calculation above)
    Core area: 9.7 cm² (calculated earlier)

You would:

    Choose a toroidal core with the required inner and outer diameter (e.g., 40 mm ID, 100 mm OD).
    Select an 18 AWG wire for 5A.
    Wind 53 turns of wire around the core, ensuring each turn is tightly wound and insulated.
