# Arduino-Based PLC for Harrow Project

This project uses an **Arduino Nano** as a **Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)** to automate the control of relays for various components in a **harrow system**. The goal is to create a custom and reliable solution for controlling different devices and features with push buttons.

## Features

1. **Relay Control with Push Buttons:**
   - When **Button 1** is pressed, **Relay 1** is activated, and it turns off when the button is released.
   - When **Button 2** is pressed, **Relay 2** is activated, and it turns off when the button is released.

2. **Timed Relay Activation:**
   - When **Button 3** is pressed and released, **Relay 2** turns on for 10 seconds, and **Relay 3** turns on for 3 seconds. This cycle repeats each time the button is pressed.
   
3. **Timed Relay for Safety Feature:**
   - When **Button 4** is pressed and released, **Relay 3** turns on for 3 seconds to ensure safe operation.

## Purpose of the Project

This Arduino-based PLC aims to replace traditional PLC systems with a more cost-effective solution, leveraging the power of Arduino to control devices like relays, actuators, or sensors in a **harrow system** (or similar machinery).

The project is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing users to easily modify the relay logic, timing, and inputs to suit their needs.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Nano** (Main controller)
- **4 Push Buttons** (For user input)
- **3 Relay Modules** (For controlling external devices like motors, sensors, or actuators)
- **10kÎ© Resistors** (For pull-down resistors on push buttons)
- **Jumper Wires** (For connecting components)
- **Power Supply** (For the Arduino and relays)

## Wiring Diagram

1. **Button 1:** Connect to Arduino Pin D2
2. **Button 2:** Connect to Arduino Pin D3
3. **Button 3:** Connect to Arduino Pin D4
4. **Button 4:** Connect to Arduino Pin D5
5. **Relay 1:** Connect to Arduino Pin D6
6. **Relay 2:** Connect to Arduino Pin D7
7. **Relay 3:** Connect to Arduino Pin D8

**Note:** Each button is connected to GND and uses the `INPUT_PULLUP` mode to simplify wiring (no external resistors required). The relay modules are connected to the Arduino's 5V and GND pins for power.

## Code Description

##Key Functions:

**Button Handling:** Each button controls one or more relays. The logic uses the internal pull-up resistor of the Arduino, so pressing a button connects the pin to GND, registering a LOW state.

**Relay Control:** Relays are turned ON or OFF based on button states or timed actions. Each relay has a dedicated pin on the Arduino to control its state.

**Timed Actions:** Buttons 3 and 4 trigger timed actions where specific relays are activated for a defined period (10 seconds for Relay 2 and 3 seconds for Relay 3).

# Installation Instructions

# Conclusion

This Arduino-based PLC solution is a flexible, cost-effective approach to controlling relays for various applications. It provides an excellent learning experience for anyone interested in automation systems and microcontroller programming.

Relay Control with Push Buttons:

When HydraulicButton is pressed, Relay 1 is activated, and it turns off when the button is released.
When ManualMotoronbutton is pressed, Motorrelay is activated, and it turns off when the button is released.
Timed Relay Activation:

When selector1 is pressed and released, Motorrelay turns on for 10 seconds, and BuzzerRelay turns on for 3 seconds. This cycle repeats each time the button is pressed.
Timed Relay for Safety Feature:

When selector2 is pressed and released, BuzzerRelay turns on for 3 seconds to ensure safe operation.
