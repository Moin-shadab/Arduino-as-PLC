1st Feature: Toggle Switch (Relay 1 Control)
Goal: When the toggle switch is pressed, Relay 1 should turn ON. When released, Relay 1 should turn OFF.
Wiring:
Connect one leg of the toggle switch to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 12).
Connect the other leg of the toggle switch to GND.
The relay module should be connected to another GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 14).
Code: Use a simple digitalRead() function to check if the toggle switch is pressed and control Relay 1 accordingly.
2nd Feature: Push Button (Relay 2 Control)
Goal: When the push button is pressed, Relay 2 should turn ON for the duration the button is pressed.
Wiring:
Connect one leg of the push button to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 13).
Connect the other leg of the push button to GND.
The relay module should be connected to another GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 15).
Code: When the button is pressed, Relay 2 should be ON; when released, it should turn OFF.
3rd Feature: Limit Switch (Relay 3 & Relay 2 Control)
Goal: When the limit switch is pressed, Relay 3 should turn ON for 3 seconds, and Relay 2 should turn ON for 4 seconds.
Wiring:
Connect one leg of the limit switch to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 16).
Connect the other leg of the limit switch to GND.
Connect Relay 3 to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 17).
Connect Relay 2 to another GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 15).
Code: When the limit switch is pressed, the code will activate Relay 3 for 3 seconds and Relay 2 for 4 seconds, then turn them both off.
4th Feature: Second Limit Switch (Relay 3 Control)
Goal: When the second limit switch is pressed, Relay 3 should turn ON for 1 second, then turn OFF.
Wiring:
Connect the second limit switch to a GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 18).
Connect Relay 3 to the same GPIO pin as in the previous step (e.g., GPIO 17).
Code: When the limit switch is pressed, Relay 3 should turn ON for 1 second and then turn OFF.
Summary of Wiring:
Toggle Switch (Relay 1):

GPIO 12 → Toggle Switch → GND
GPIO 14 → Relay 1
Push Button (Relay 2):

GPIO 13 → Push Button → GND
GPIO 15 → Relay 2
Limit Switch 1 (Relay 3 and Relay 2):

GPIO 16 → Limit Switch 1 → GND
GPIO 17 → Relay 3
GPIO 15 → Relay 2 (same as for the push button)
Limit Switch 2 (Relay 3):

GPIO 18 → Limit Switch 2 → GND
GPIO 17 → Relay 3 (same as for Limit Switch 1)

hi am using arduino nano 

i need feature like this when 

1. when one push button pressed then relay 1 on when release relay 1 off

2. when second  push button pressed relay 2 on when release relay 2 off 

3. when third push button just pressed and instantly released then relay 2 on for 10 sec and relay 3 on for 3 sec again when he pressed then again same cycle 

4. when fourth push button just pressed and released instantly then relay 3 on for 3 sec after it off 

all work independently push buttons use safety features accto you give wiring also and code 
note every action performed when button pressed not on power o
